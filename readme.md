Feel free to use it in any way. If you have some request or idea to implement just open an [issue](https://github.com/Borecjeborec1/Mortart-Squad-Calculator/issues).

If you want to add some map, just open an [issue](https://github.com/Borecjeborec1/Mortart-Squad-Calculator/issues) again with a map name and it size and I will try to implement it asap.
